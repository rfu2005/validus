Music project

## Notes:

1. The pagination is supposed to be working for Angular 13 according to the package description. It may not work for Angular below 13.
2. It uses the sever-side pagination. If the records are not supposed to be too much, the client-side pagination is better.
3. If an error occurres for API calls, it has been logged in the console only, but not on the web page.
4. Styling is minimum, and not consolidated.
5. One testing case has been added in the file **src/app/components/song/song.component.spec.ts** for the demo purposes.
6. A video has been attached with the project.
